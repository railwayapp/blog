## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

We also have a [detailed guide](https://blog.railway.app/p/notion-public-api) on our blog to help users deploy a similar blog using Railway.

### Step 1: Create a notion DB
You can find instructions on how to [set up the Notion Database](https://blog.railway.app/p/next-notion-blog#setting-up-our-cms-on-notion), TLDR you need the following fields, in an Inline Database on a page, it needs to be inline, else it won't work

- Page (Title) - The page containing a post
- Slug (Text) - The URL of a post
- Published (Checkbox) - Only published blog posts show up on the website
- Date (Date) - The date the post was published
- Authors (Person) - A list of users that wrote the post
- Image (Text) - The URL of the meta image for a post

### Step 2: Create a Notion Integration

This will be done on Notion's [Manage Integration page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations), copy the token, this will be used as `NOTION_API_TOKEN` 

### Step 3: Get a hold of your Database ID

You can get this from the URL of the page, whose structure is `https://www.notion.so/<user>/<database_Id>?v=....` , the database_Id will be used as `POSTS_TABLE_ID` 

That is it, Just make sure the properties are not empty
